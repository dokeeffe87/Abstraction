0,"We argue that the Kovtun--Son--Starinets (KSS) lower bound on the viscosity
to entropy density ratio holds in fluid systems but is violated in solid
materials with a non-zero shear elastic modulus. We construct explicit examples
of this by applying the standard gauge/gravity duality methods to massive
gravity and show that the KSS bound is clearly violated in black brane
solutions whenever the massive gravity theories are of solid type. We argue
that the physical reason for the bound violation relies on the viscoelastic
nature of the mechanical response in these materials. We speculate on whether
any real-world materials can violate the bound and discuss a possible
generalization of the bound that involves the ratio of the shear elastic
modulus to the pressure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03384v1,Victoria University of Wellington,['hep-th'],1601.03384,"['Lasma Alberte, Matteo Baggioli, Oriol Pujolas']",0,No journal ref found,hep-th,2016-01-13T20:57:43Z,"Viscosity bound violation in holographic solids and the viscoelastic

1,"We consider the field theory of a superconductor with a topological axion
term and construct its dual theories for both bulk and boundary at strong
coupling. The theory describes, e.g., a conventional superconductor sandwiched
between two topological insulators. The interacting topological states that
emerge are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_8$ invariant and the strong coupling
boundary theory is shown to be purely topological. These topological states
lack a non-interacting equivalent. Due to the Witten effect, magnetic monopoles
attain a fractional electric charge. This leads to an anomalous AC Josephson
current generated by external magnetic fields.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03382v1,INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma,"['cond-mat.supr-con', 'hep-th']",1601.03382,"['Flavio S.

2,"We consider the geometric and supergravity Killing spinors and the spinor
bilinears constructed out of them. The spinor bilinears of geometric Killing
spinors correspond to the antisymmetric generalizations of Killing vector
fields which are called Killing-Yano forms. They constitute a Lie superalgebra
structure in constant curvature spacetimes. We show that the Dirac currents of
geometric Killing spinors satisfy a Lie algebra structure up to a condition on
2-form spinor bilinears. We propose that the spinor bilinears of supergravity
Killing spinors give way to different generalizations of Killing vector fields
to higher degree forms. It is also shown that those supergravity Killing forms
constitute a Lie algebra structure in six and ten dimensional cases. For five
and eleven dimensional cases, the Lie algebra structure depends on an extra
condition on supergravity Killing forms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03356v1,Indian Statistical Institute,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']",1601.03356,"['Ümit Ertem, Özgür Açık']",0,No journal ref found,hep-th,2016-01-13T19:18:05Z,"Hidden Symmetries and Lie Algebra Structures from Geometric and

3,"Under normal circumstances most members of the general relativity community
focus almost exclusively on the local properties of spacetime, such as the
locally Euclidean structure of the manifold and the Lorentzian signature of the
metric tensor. When combined with the classical Einstein field equations this
gives an extremely successful empirical model of classical gravity and
classical matter --- at least as long as one does not ask too many awkward
questions about global issues, (such as global topology and global causal
structure). We feel however that this is a tactical error --- even without
invoking full-fledged ""quantum gravity"" we know that the standard model of
particle physics is also an extremely good representation of some parts of
empirical reality; and we had better be able to carry over all the good
features of the standard model of particle physics --- at least into the realm
of semi-classical quantum gravity. Doing so gives us some interesting global
features that spacetime should possess: On physical grounds spacetime should be
space-orientable, time-orientable, and spacetime-orientable, and it should
possess a globally defined tetrad (vierbein, or in general a globally defined
vielbein/n-bein). So on physical grounds spacetime should be parallelizable.
This strongly suggests that the metric is not the fundamental physical
quantity; a very good case can be made for the tetrad being more fundamental
than the metric. Furthermore, a globally-defined ""almost complex structure"" is
almost unavoidable. Ideas along these lines have previously been mooted, but
much is buried in the pre-arXiv literature and is either forgotten or
inaccessible. We shall revisit these ideas taking a perspective very much based
on empirical physical observation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03355v1,Victoria University of Wellington,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1601.03355,"['Deloshan Nawarajan, Matt Visser']",0,No journal ref found,gr-qc,2016-01-13T19:17:06Z,Global properties of physically interesting Lorentzian spacetimes
4,"We study the perturbative generation of higher-derivative operators as
corrections to the photon effective action, which are originated from a Lorentz
violation background. Such corrections are obtained, at one-loop order, through
the proper-time method, using the zeta function regularization. We focus over
the lowest order corrections and investigate their influence in the propagation
of electromagnetic waves through the vacuum, in the presence of a strong,
constant magnetic field. This is a setting of experimental relevance, since it
bases active efforts to measure non linear electromagnetic effects. After
surprising cancellations of Lorentz violating corrections to the Maxwell's
equation, we show that no effects of the kind of Lorentz violation we consider
can be detected in such a context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03298v1,,['hep-th'],1601.03298,"['L. H. C. Borges, A. G. Dias, A. F. Ferrari, J. R. Nascimento, A. Yu. Petrov']",0,No journal ref found,hep-th,2016-01-13T16:10:24Z,"Generation of higher derivatives operators and electromagnetic wave

5,"Horava gravity theory possesses global Lifshitz space as a solution and has
been conjectured to provide a natural framework for Lifshitz holography. We
derive the conditions on the two derivative Horava gravity Lagrangian that are
necessary for static, asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes with flat transverse
dimensions to contain a universal horizon, which plays a similar thermodynamic
role as the Killing horizon in general relativity. Specializing to z=2 in 1+2
dimensions, we then numerically construct such regular solutions over the whole
spacetime. We calculate the mass for these solutions and show that, unlike the
asymptotically anti-de Sitter case, the first law applied to the universal
horizon is straightforwardly compatible with a thermodynamic interpretation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03274v1,,['hep-th'],1601.03274,"['Sayandeb Basu, Jishnu Bhattacharyya, David Mattingly, Matthew Roberson']",0,No journal ref found,hep-th,2016-01-13T15:12:50Z,"Asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes with universal horizons in $(1 + 2)$

6,"We study the dynamics of quantum coherence under Unruh thermal noise and seek
under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We
find that the quantum coherence can not be frozen for any acceleration due to
the effect of Unruh thermal noise. We also find that quantum coherence is more
robust than entanglement under the effect of Unruh thermal noise and therefore
the coherence type quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic
quantum information processing tasks. Besides, the dynamic of quantum coherence
is found to be more sensitive than entanglement to the preparation of the
detectors' initial state and the atom-field coupling strength, while it is less
sensitive than entanglement to the acceleration of the detector.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03238v1,,"['quant-ph', 'gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1601.03238,"['Jieci Wang, Zehua Tian, Jiliang Jing, Heng Fan']",0,No journal ref found,quant-ph,2016-01-13T13:30:44Z,Irreversible degradation of quantum coherence under relativistic motion

from the fluid/gravity correspondence in order to constrain the post-Newtonian
parameter of brane-world metrics. In particular, we analyse the
Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati (CFM) effective solutions for the gravity side of
the correspondence and argue that including higher order terms in the
hydrodynamic expansion can lead to a full agreement with the experimental
bounds for the Eddington-Robertson-Schiff post-Newtonian parameter of the CFM

9,"The grand partition functions of ABJ theory can be factorized into even and
odd parts under the reflection of fermion coordinate in the Fermi gas approach.
In some cases, the even/odd part of ABJ grand partition function is equal to
that of $\mathcal{N}=5$ $O(n)\times USp(n')$ theory, hence it is natural to
think of the even/odd projection of grand partition function as an
orientifolding of ABJ Fermi gas system. By a systematic WKB analysis, we
determine the coefficients in the perturbative part of grand potential of such
orientifold ABJ theory. We also find the exact form of the first few
""half-instanton"" corrections coming from the twisted sector of the reflection
of fermion coordinate. For the Chern-Simons level $k=2,4,8$ we find closed form
expressions of the grand partition functions of orientifold ABJ theory, and for

an ab initio definition of the spin-one-half expansion coefficients and their

11,"We study the effective field theory of 2D fermions with a short-range
interaction in the presence of a van Hove singularity. We find that there are
additional divergences associated with the singularity that necessitate
regularization beyond the usual Wilsonian cut-off. In the full theory these
divergences are cut off by the finite size of the Brillouin zone. This leads to
a UV/IR mixing and causes the RG equation for the coupling constant to have an
explicit dependence on the ratio of the Wilsonian cut-off to the bandwidth. We
discuss the properties of the superconducting ground state and the transport
properties of the normal state and show that the latter are approximately
described by the marginal Fermi liquid scenario. To leading order, our results
are universal in the sense that they do not depend upon the nature of the
non-van Hove portion of the Fermi surface. We also comment on the van Hove

inflation in the non-minimal derivative coupling (NDC) model withchaotic
potential. In general, this model is known to provide an enhanced slow-roll
inflation caused by gravitationally enhanced friction. We find violent
oscillations of Hubble parameter which induces oscillations of the sound speed
squared, implying the Lagrangian instability of curvature perturbation $\zeta$
under the comoving gauge $\varphi=0$. However, we show that this instability
disappears in the superhorizon limit. Furthermore, it is shown that the
curvature perturbation blows up at $\dot{\phi}=0$, leading to the breakdown of
the comoving gauge at $\dot{\phi}=0$. The breakdown of the comoving gauge might
not be resolved by introducing the $cd$-gauge in the NDC model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03148v1,,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1601.03148,"['Yun Soo Myung, Taeyoon Moon']",0,No journal ref found,gr-qc,2016-01-13T07:20:02Z,Inflaton decay and reheating in nonminimal derivative coupling
13,"We study a model of resonant multilead point-contact tunneling by using the
boundary state formulation. At a critical point the model is described by
multi-flavor chiral fermions on an infinite line with a point contact
interaction at the origin. By applying the folding procedure, previously
developed for the model of resonant point-contact tunneling of a single lead,
we map the model onto a non-chiral fermion model defined on the half line. The
resonant point-contact tunneling interaction is transcribed into a non-local
effective boundary interaction in the folded setup, where the boundary state
formulation is applicable. We construct the boundary states for the models with
two and three leads explicitly and evaluate the correlation functions of
currents operators exactly. The electron transport between the leads is
dominated by the resonant point-contact tunneling in the low frequency regime.

useful to analyze more complex models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03126v1,,"['cond-mat.str-el', 'hep-th']",1601.03126,['Taejin Lee'],0,No journal ref found,cond-mat.str-el,2016-01-13T04:28:33Z,Resonant Multilead Point-Contact Tunneling: Boundary State Formulation

collapse into gauge invariant and gauge-dependent components, at least for some

fine-structure constant $\alpha$, are a powerful probe of new physics. Recently
these measurements, combined with local atomic clock tests and Type Ia
supernova and Hubble parameter data, were used to constrain the simplest class
of dynamical dark energy models where the same degree of freedom is assumed to
provide both the dark energy and (through a dimensionless coupling, $\zeta$, to
the electromagnetic sector) the $\alpha$ variation. One caveat of these
analyses was that it was based on fiducial models where the dark energy
equation of state was described by a single parameter (effectively its present
day value, $w_0$). Here we relax this assumption and study broader dark energy
model classes, including the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Early Dark Energy
parametrizations. Even in these extended cases we find that the current data
constrains the coupling $\zeta$ at the $10^{-6}$ level and $w_0$ to a few
percent (marginalizing over other parameters), thus confirming the robustness
of earlier analyses. On the other hand, the additional parameters are typically
not well constrained. We also highlight the implications of our results for

conformal invariance up to a set of OPE coefficients, and we identify the
allowed tensor structures. A correlator of two bulk primaries depends on two
cross-ratios, and we study its conformal block decomposition in the case of
external scalars. The Casimir equation in the defect channel reduces to a
hypergeometric equation, while the bulk channel blocks are recursively

a four-point function without defect. Finally, we analyze the contact terms of

supersymmetry breaking is introduced then standard NJL behaviour is realized.
In examples where chiral symmetry breaking is not preferred such as with a B

the model already contains chiral symmetry breaking, for example in the B field
case with no IR cut off, then the NJL interaction enhances the quark mass at

these backgrounds, leading to $\eta/s < 1/(4\pi)$ at all finite temperatures
(even in Einstein gravity). As the temperature is taken to zero, different

parametrically small. If the translation symmetry is broken in the far IR

key observation, which to our knowledge has not been very well appreciated, is
that asymptotic boundary conditions play an essential role on extending the
replica trick to the bulk. For non-AAdS, we expect the following three main
modifications: 1. The expansion near the special surface has to be compatible
with the asymptotic expansion. 2. Periodic conditions are imposed to
coordinates on the phase space with diagonalized symplectic structure, not to
all fields appearing in the action. 3. Evaluating the entanglement functional

presented. Two degenerate metrics on the $4+d$-dimensional total manifold are
used, one corresponding to the spacetime metric and giving the fiber of the

horizontal bundle of the connection. When combined, the two metrics give the
Kaluza metric and its generalization to the non-abelian case, justifying thus
his choice. Considering the two metrics as fundamental rather than the Kaluza
metric explains why Kaluza's theory should not be regarded as five-dimensional
vacuum gravity. This approach suggests that the only evidence of extra
dimensions is given by the existence of the gauge forces, explaining thus why
other kinds of evidence are not available. In addition, because the degenerate
metric corresponding to the spacetime metric vanishes along the extra
dimensions, the lengths in the extra dimensions is zero, preventing us to
directly probe them. Therefore this approach suggests that it is not justified
to search for experimental evidence of the extra dimensions as if they are
merely extra spacetime dimensions. On the other hand the new approach uses a

In this paper we initiate the study of such compactifications and determine the
dictionary between the geometric data of the elliptic fibration and the 2d
gauge theory such as the matter content in terms of (0,2) superfields and their
supersymmetric couplings. We study this setup both from a gauge-theoretic point
of view, in terms of the partially twisted 7-brane theory, and provide a global
geometric description based on the structure of the elliptic fibration and its
singularities. Global consistency conditions are determined and checked against
the dual M-theory compactification to one dimension. This includes a discussion
of gauge anomalies, the structure of the Green-Schwarz terms and the
Chern-Simons couplings in the dual M-theory supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Furthermore, by interpreting the resulting 2d (0,2) theories as heterotic
worldsheet theories, we propose a correspondence between the geometric data of
elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau five-folds and the target space of a heterotic
gauged linear sigma-model (GLSM). In particular the correspondence between the

if the coefficients depend on a small parameter $\ep$ (the dimensional

cyclotomic sums, generalized harmonic sums or nested binomial sums), then we
can calculate them. If the algorithm fails, we obtain a proof that the terms

However, we find that $S_E$ does not show an expected monotonic behaviour as a
function of the coupling $J_z$ between the suitably defined one-dimensional
chains within the gapless phase for either geometry; moreover the system
generically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase
before the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is
reached. This may be attributed to the competition between the nearest
neighbour correlation functions of the $x-x$ and $z-z$ bonds, and to the onset
of gapless $\vec{k}$-modes in the bulk spectrum. On the other hand $S_E$ always
monotonically varies with $J_z$ in the gapped phase independent of the
subregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture,
we find that the Schmidt gap $\Delta$ defined from the entanglement spectrum

holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models
obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for all boundary regions, whether
connected or not, a fact closely related to known properties of the

regions faithfully encode the physics of their entire bulk entanglement wedges,
not just their smaller causal wedges. Our method is to interpret the average

Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain
walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model
reproduces the expected corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the bulk
minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement
of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately
creates the analog of a black hole, with an associated Hawking-Page phase
transition. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits
the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit
a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest, a

83,"We investigate vacuum statistics and stability in random axionic landscapes.
For this purpose we developed an algorithm for a quick evaluation of the
tunneling action, which in most cases is accurate within 10%. We find that
stability of a vacuum is strongly correlated with its energy density, with
lifetime rapidly growing as the energy density is decreased. The probability
$P(B)$ for a vacuum to have a tunneling action $B$ greater than a given value
declines as a slow power law in $B$. This is in sharp contrast with the studies
of random quartic potentials, which found a fast exponential decline of $P(B)$.
Our results suggest that the total number of relatively stable vacua (say, with
$B> 100$) grows exponentially with the number of fields $N$ and can get
extremely large for $N\gtrsim 100$. The problem with this kind of model is that
the stable vacua are concentrated near the absolute minimum of the potential,
so the observed value of the cosmological constant cannot be explained without
fine-tuning. To address this difficulty, we consider a modification of the
model, where the axions acquire a quadratic mass term, due to their mixing with
4-form fields. This results in a larger landscape with a much broader
distribution of vacuum energies. The number of relatively stable vacua in such
models can still be extremely large.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01662v1,,"['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",1601.01662,"['Ali Masoumi, Alexander Vilenkin']",0,No journal ref found,gr-qc,2016-01-07T20:46:41Z,Vacuum statistics and stability in axionic landscapes
84,"In this letter, we explore the nature of the electroweak phase transition
(EWPT) with both particle colliders and gravitational wave (GW) detection. With
the observed Higgs mass, the shape of the Higgs potential is fully determined
within the standard model (SM) of particle physics. However, it could be
changed if there exists new physics beyond the SM. Working with the effective
field theory, we show that a modified Higgs potential with a sextic term
included can keep the observed 125 GeV Higgs mass but behave different when
compared with the SM case. Furthermore, this potential can produce a strong
first order phase transition (SFOPT) for the electroweak baryogenesis and
interestingly predict new phenomena in the Higgs sector, which can be tested at
colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the planning Circular
Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). We point out this SFOPT can lead to

black hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum
state is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon.
Charge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations
between the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair

137,"The recent excess in diphoton events around 750 GeV seen by the ATLAS and CMS
experiments could be hinting at the existence of new vector-like charged matter
around the TeV scale which couples to a singlet. Such a spectrum of exotics
arises inevitably in certain classes of F-theory GUTs with hypercharge flux
when the GUT symmetry is extended by a U(1) symmetry under which the Higgs
fields of the MSSM are not vector-like. The exotics are not vector-like under
the U(1) symmetry and therefore their mass is naturally related to its breaking
scale. Previously this scale was taken to be close to the GUT scale which led
to tension with proton decay, the $\mu$-term magnitude, and too large R-parity
violation. The 750 GeV excess provides new motivation for considering breaking
the U(1) around the TeV scale, which additionally alleviates the previous
problems. We study the possible TeV-scale spectrum in such an SU(5) GUT
scenario and show that it is constrained and predictive. Gauge coupling
unification can be retained at the accuracy of the MSSM at one loop even though
typically the spectrum does not form complete GUT representations. For example
the exotics cannot form a complete 10 multiplet but nonetheless happen to
behave as one in the beta functions. We present an initial analysis of the

curvature. Making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence we can map the bulk

constant which becomes small at times when the bulk space-time is highly
curved. We investigate the propagation of small fluctuations of a test scalar
field from early times before the bulk singularity to late times after the
singularity. Under the assumption that the AdS/CFT correspondence extends to
deformed AdS space-times, we can map the bulk evolution of the scalar field
onto the evolution of the boundary gauge field. The time evolution of
linearized fluctuations is well defined in the boundary theory as long as the
coupling remains finite, so that we can extend the boundary perturbations to
late times after the singularity. Assuming that the spacetime in the future of
the singularity has a weakly coupled region near the boundary, we reconstruct
the bulk fluctuations after the singularity crossing making use of generic
properties of boundary-to-bulk propagators. Finally, we extract the spectrum of
the fluctuations at late times given some initial spectrum. We find that the
spectral index is unchanged, but the amplitude increases due to the squeezing

way to define operators at any given scale in terms of appropriate
coarse-grained collective variables, without requiring the use of the
elementary fields. The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the
cut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria
to determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective
Ward identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should
preserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and
sources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The
second criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the
actual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the
collective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final required
criterion is that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be
transformed to a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic
equations with a finite number of parameters, such as incompressible
non-relativistic Navier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the
scale and of the time coordinate. Using previous work, we explicitly show that

constructed and analyzed. We focus in the special case of the purely quadratic
Lagrangian, whose field equations are irreducibly of fourth order and are known
to admit asymptotically locally flat black holes endowed with gravitational
hair. The first class corresponds to a Kerr-Schild deformation of Minkowski
spacetime along a covariantly constant null vector. As in the case of General
Relativity, the field equations linearize so that the solution can be easily
shown to be described by four arbitrary functions of a single null coordinate.
These solutions can be regarded as a new sort of pp-waves. The second class is
obtained from a deformation of the static asymptotically locally flat black
hole, that goes along the spacelike (angular) Killing vector. Remarkably,
although the deformation is not of Kerr-Schild type, the field equations also
linearize, and hence the generic solution can be readily integrated. It is
neither static nor spherically symmetric, being described by two integration
constants and two arbitrary functions of the angular coordinate. In the static

configurations of relativistic fluids to the first two non-trivial orders in a

fluid are described by a thermal partition function with arbitrary stationary

among surface transport coefficients. At leading order, besides recovering the

dependence in the surface tension, which is further generalized in the context
of superfluids. At the next order, for uncharged fluids in 3+1 dimensions, we

surface transport coefficients, one of which may be identified with the surface
modulus of rigidity. Finally, as an application, we study the effect of

266,"Motivated by dualistic considerations of the reality of quark condensation in
quantum chromodynamics, and the connections of supergravity to the exotic
physics of string and M-theory, in this thesis we investigate the dynamical
breaking of local supersymmetry via gravitino condensation. We firstly
demonstrate non-perturbative gravitino mass generation via this mechanism in
flat spacetime, and from this derive the condensate mode wavefunction
renormalisation. By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop
effective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we
demonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both
occur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we
find that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the
condensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign
of the tree-level cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that the energy
density liberated may provide the necessary inflation of the early universe via
an effective scalar degree of freedom, provided by the condensate, acting as
the inflaton. However, in so doing we find that simultaneously
phenomenologically viable inflation and supersymmetry breaking via this
approach are mutually incompatible in the simplest supergravity settings. As
this mechanism takes place in the gravitational sector, relying on the
ubiquitous gravitino torsion terms, we argue that it can also enjoy a certain
universality in the context of supergravity and string theories, in that it
does not rely on specific or arbitrary choices of potential and/or matter
content. This then allows straightforward transplantation of these results into
other settings. We present in detail our findings establishing contact between

manifold swept by a propagating membrane. This and related field theories are

string and membrane backgrounds can be conveniently described using objects
defined on a direct sum of tangent and cotangent bundles of the spacetime
manifold. Mathematical field studying such object is called generalized

271,"Landscape analyses often assume the existence of large numbers of fields,
$N$, with all of the many couplings among these fields (subject to constraints
such as local supersymmetry) selected independently and randomly from simple

place significant constraints on behavior of couplings with $N$, eliminating
otherwise puzzling results. In would-be flux compactifications of string
theory, we point out that in order that there be large numbers of light fields,
the compactification radii must scale as a positive power of $N$; scaling of
the radii and couplings with $N$ may also be necessary for perturbativity. We
show that in some simple string theory settings with large numbers of fields,
for fixed $R$ and string coupling, one can bound certain sums of squares of
couplings by order one numbers. This may argue for strong correlations,
possibly calling into question the assumption of random distributions. We

We discuss the Wigner classifications of unitary irreducible
Poincar\'e-modules, write down covariant field equations for totally symmetric
massive and massless representations in flat space, and consider their
Lagrangian formulation. After an elementary exposition of the AdS unitary
representations, we review the key no-go and yes-go results concerning
higher-spin interactions, e.g., the Velo-Zwanziger acausality and its
string-theoretic resolution among others. The unfolded formalism, which
underlies Vasiliev's equations, is then introduced to reformulate the
flat-space Bargmann-Wigner equations and the AdS massive-scalar Klein-Gordon
equation, and to state the ""central on-mass-shell theorem"". These techniques
are used for deriving the unfolded form of the boundary-to-bulk propagator in
$AdS_4$, which in turn discloses the asymptotic symmetries of (supersymmetric)
higher-spin theories. The implications for string-higher-spin dualities

298,"We consider an effective viscous pressure as the result of a backreaction of
inhomogeneities within Buchert's formalism. The use of an effective metric with
a time-dependent curvature radius allows us to calculate the luminosity
distance of the backreaction model. This quantity is different from its
counterpart for a ""conventional"" spatially flat bulk viscous fluid universe.
Both expressions are tested against the SNIa data of the Union2.1 sample with
only marginally different results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07835v1,,"['gr-qc', 'astro-ph.CO', 'hep-th']",1512.07835,"['Rodrigo M. Barbosa, Eddy G. Chirinos I., Winfried Zimdahl, Oliver F. Piattella']",0,No journal ref found,gr-qc,2015-12-24T15:12:50Z,Cosmic bulk viscosity through backreaction
299,"Motivated by a recent work on asymptotically Ad$S_4$ black holes in M-theory,
we investigate both thermodynamics and thermodynamical geometry of
Raissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes from M2-branes. More precisely, we study AdS
black holes in $AdS_{4}\times S^{7}$, with the number of M2-branes interpreted
as a thermodynamical variable. In this context, we calculate various
thermodynamical quantities including the chemical potential, and examine their
phase transitions along with the corresponding stability behaviors. In
addition, we also evaluate the thermodynamical curvatures of the Weinhold,
Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics for M2-branes geometry to study the stability of
such black object. We show that the singularities of these scalar curvature's
metrics reproduce similar stability results obtained by the phase transition
program via the heat capacities in different ensembles either when the number
of the M2 branes or the charge are held fixed. Also, we note that all results
derived in [1] are recovered in the limit of the vanishing charge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07832v1,,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']",1512.07832,"['M. Chabab, H. EL Moumni, K. Masmar']",0,No journal ref found,hep-th,2015-12-24T15:03:09Z,"Thermodynamics of Charged AdS Black Holes in Extended Phases Space via
